# Exp6_Looping-in-cpp
oops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. This experiment demonstrates the use of different types of loops in C++, including for, while, and do-while loops. Loops help in tasks like printing patterns, iterating through data, and automating repetitive operations efficiently.
